## Introduction

> A homebrew kernel written in C and assembly with the intention of learning learning more about how the system works at a lower level than conventional programming

## Installation

> There is currently no "install", only a live CD environment that is built using "make iso". This kernel is multiboot compliant and uses unmodified Grub as the boot loader.
